# Before we begin

Learning a new subject gets harder by the day.
In particular, statistics and probability theory can be some of the most difficult as it involves a blend of 
mathematics and english to properly understand and define the problem to be solved.
Therefore, I believe it is critical to optimize your learning process by first outlining your entire journey.
By understanding where you are on the map, it becomes easier to find your way back - if and when you need to.

This is just my learning style, but even on subjects I struggle to understand, I do not stop and spend additional hours
piecing everything together. Rather, I find that skimming through the material and moving on to the next chapter often helps
as when it comes up again, I am able to flag the relevance of the said topic with respect to the bigger picture
which makes it a lot easier to understand it when I reread the material.

Other notes:
1. You will see a lot of Greek letters - worst of all, different sources will use different letters to represent the same variable
2. A lot of confusing terminology will come up, make sure to go back and review every now and then to really make sure you have it down


# Basics topics to review before proceeding

Note that these are not mandatory, but simply topics that would make your learning curve less steep if you are familiar with the concepts.
1. Euler's constant
2. Fundamentals of probability theory
