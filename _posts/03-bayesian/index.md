# Intro to Bayesian Statistics

Here is my favorite definition of Bayesian Stat - 
'the role of prob dist in Bayesian data analysis is to represent uncertainty, and the role of Bayesian 
stat is to update the prob dist to reflect what has been learned from the data'

For a more hands-on start w/ visuals (i.e. graphs), then I highly recommend the 'Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis'
course from DataCamp.

The intent of this is to act as a diary through my process of learning Bayesian Statistics to meet my ultimate goal
of learning Probabilistic Programming.

The definition of Bayesian Statistics:
Bayesian statistics works under subjectiveness. That is when compared to frequentist statistics, the probability
of something occurring is purely a reflection or representation of the degrees of belief.

What does this mean?

Here is an inline equation \( E = mc^2 \).

Notations:
H = hypothesis
E = evidence
